# Learning About Version Control
by Shannon Pflueger

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

What I like most about version control:

or we liked better, or maybe or new changes didn't work as planned.

What I find the most confusing about version control:
I have found resolving conflicts in jupyter notebooks quite confusing.
